# Pulmonary-Disease-Detection (Computer Vision- OpenCV)
This project is based on implementation of Kernel function based on Ramanujan sums for computer vision to diagnose pulmonary diseases.

Developed an image kernel using OpenCV, Keras libraries using python.A third order kernel matrix for edge detection is an image processor which recognizes whether the image input have pulmonary disease based on the model trained and graph plotted using OpenCV functions.

It takes images form a specific directory "data/test/" and runs it with the ramanujam sums function to determine whether the lungs image are the one which are infected by TB or not. There is a file named trainingdata, which trains the data and then the images are read from the directory which will be a test data for this program The edges are marked and thus it determines whether a healthy lung or a ruptured lungs image is being read. This helps in early detection of the pulmonary diseases.

The research papers used to develop this project are in the folder named : "Papers"

The final report of the project is in "Report"

This Project was done in collaboration with **Rakshith Churchagundi Amarnath**.
